   <p> So my friend/coding guru encouraged me to start a blog of my journey through bootcamp and coding in general. Given his experience and the fact he's who kind of talked me into all this, I intend to listen. 
    The prework walked me through everything so simply it really wasn't hard to figure out at all. I think the biggest issue I had was finding one small mistake I had made that wasn't letting the color in one section render correctly.
    It gave us a template to work with and we had to fill in that template with html, css, and js to design the study guide this blog is attached to.
   </p>

   <p>The first day I was extremely nervous and quickly discovered it wasn't warranted. For multiple reasons it turns out.
    First off, multiple people hadn't even been able to figure out the prework, and half of the first day was orientation. We started learning the building blocks of html - again using a pretty easy to follow template. We learned about the head and body, how to create headers and attach basic images.
    I found myself helping my classmates more than I expected given I thought I was lost to begin with, lol.
    All in all it gave me some ease about my experience level being nearly none.
   </p>

   <p>The second day we began learning how to code and link css files to html files. I got a little more lost on this one, but quickly figured it out.
    We learned how to assign css code to the different elements of the html file to add color to the text and background. We also learned the difference between semantic and non-semantic html elements.
    I started to feel a little more out of my element (ha) on this one, but I'm getting it.
   </p>

   <p>The third day I was super nervous to get our first challenge. So nervous I called up my coding buddy having a minor freak out about what I needed to do. After a bit of coaching to just sit down and put my fingers on the keys.. I did just that.
    After a bit I started to realize I did know what I needed to do, I was just psyching myself out for no reason essentially.
   </p>

   <p> **FULL DISCLOSURE** After the first week, because I did feel a fair amount of pressure and didn't want to fall behind I didn't keep up on this blog/journal as well as I should have. I don't remember the details of the second week as well, only that we got into CSS and learned the basics of using CSS to change the layout and design of a page.
     The challenge for the second week was much easier for me to sit down and figure out without panic. However, one thing that popped up in the first week of class that still hasn't been fully addressed is the auto-grading platform the boot camp is using... does not seem to want to work properly most of the time. It's been a tad frustrating to say the least.   
   </p>

   <p>The third week we began advanced CSS starting with media queries. With that I updated the css for these pages so they adjust for different screen sizes as well. We learned about responsive design, box styling, pseudo classes and pseudo elements, wireframing, etc. Again, I don't remember the exact details of this week as well, but I do know I am starting to feel more confident in each class.
    I have felt more confident answering questions when called upon and reading the documentation and actually understanding how things correlate. However, we had a holiday this week that disrupted how our schedule works and thus far I'm not enjoying that.
    The way things were before, we had two classes at the beginning of the week that were mostly lecture, followed by a third class on Thursday which is where we did our mini project and got our weekly challenge. Now because of the holiday changing the class schedule, weeks will overlap eachother.
    Now we have had two days of lecture, followed by the weekend, and the class day for our mini-project and being assigned out challenge now falls on Monday. So instead of having the weekend to focus on, work on, and research it - our assignment is followed the next day by moving onto the next class subject. Which I do not like.
    We will have to see how this plays out as the class progresses through fture holidays.
