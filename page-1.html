   <h2>&#127752 Here We Go! &#127752</h2>
   
   <p> So my friend/coding guru encouraged me to start a blog of my journey through bootcamp and coding in general. Given his experience and the fact he's who kind of talked me into all this, I intend to listen. 
    The prework walked me through everything so simply it really wasn't hard to figure out at all. I think the biggest issue I had was finding one small mistake I had made that wasn't letting the color in one section render correctly.
    It gave us a template to work with and we had to fill in that template with html, css, and js to design the study guide this blog is attached to.
   </p>

   <p>The first day I was extremely nervous and quickly discovered it wasn't warranted. For multiple reasons it turns out.
    First off, multiple people hadn't even been able to figure out the prework, and half of the first day was orientation. We started learning the building blocks of html - again using a pretty easy to follow template. We learned about the head and body, how to create headers and attach basic images.
    I found myself helping my classmates more than I expected given I thought I was lost to begin with, lol.
    All in all it gave me some ease about my experience level being nearly none.
   </p>

   <p>The second day we began learning how to code and link css files to html files. I got a little more lost on this one, but quickly figured it out.
    We learned how to assign css code to the different elements of the html file to add color to the text and background. We also learned the difference between semantic and non-semantic html elements.
    I started to feel a little more out of my element (ha) on this one, but I'm getting it.
